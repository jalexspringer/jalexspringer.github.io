## OpenAttribution

Alex is the director of [OpenAttribution.org](https://openattribution.org), a cross-industry coalition establishing transparency and attribution standards for content usage in AI systems.

OpenAttribution develops two core standards:

- **AIMS** (Agent Identity Manifest Standard) — Agent identity verification using DID-based manifests, enabling content owners to know which AI systems are accessing their content and why
- **Telemetry Standard** — Session-based content event tracking that creates an auditable trail from content ingestion through AI-generated recommendations

The initiative is Apache 2.0 licensed with multi-stakeholder governance spanning publishers, platforms, and AI providers. SDKs are available for integration.
